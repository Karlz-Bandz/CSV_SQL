# CSV_SQL
This application reads the .csv file, map it on List<object> and saves it in PostgreSQL 
  
The application works in console and will ask you to provide the path to the .csv file
that you want to save inside the database. 
When the .csv file is correct all data is mapped to the HashMap and saved into database  
by using hibernate without Spring Boot.
