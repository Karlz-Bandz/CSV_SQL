# CSV_SQL
This application reads the .csv file, map it to List<String[]> and saves in MySQL 
  
The application works in console and will ask you to provide the path to the .csv file
that you want to save inside the database. 
When the .csv file is correct all data is mapped to List<String[]> and saves in database.

At the start when you provide 1 into the console you can also delete files from database
by name or read files.

Application is flexible and reads all csv files :)

You need to provide your own username and password to hibernate.cfg.xml
